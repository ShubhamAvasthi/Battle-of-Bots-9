# Battle-of-Bots-9
This is my submission for Battle of Bots #9 held on HackerEarth which was ranked 2nd in India and 7th in the world.

Battle of Bots is HackerEarth's flagship Artificial Intelligence Challenge. It's one of a kind challenge that runs for 6 days. There is only one problem statement in the challenge - the game for which the contestants have to write a bot.

A two-player game is given and the contestants have to write a bot that will play that game against other bots. The bot has to adhere to the rules of the game given in the problem statement, and play against the other bot.

Also one can challenge other people who have submitted their bots to play against them. Once the challenge is over, all the bots that have been submitted are played against other bots in a tournament. The bot that wins the tournament is declared the winner.
